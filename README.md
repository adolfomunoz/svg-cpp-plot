# svg-cpp-plot
A simple C++17 header-only library for generating SVG images and plots. It provides a huge (undocumented) codebase that serves as base for smaller (partially documented) useful APIs and executable files for different specific applications.

These applications are:

- [SVGPlot](./doc/svgplot.md): API for plotting different types of graphs in a `matplotlib.pyplot` way with vector (SVG) output.
- More on the way.
